# React.js Minimal Template

This project was created because I wanted to test my own ideas in React ES6 app but got tired of setting up whole toolchain everytime.

## Technologies

* node (https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Babel (https://babeljs.io/)
* Typings (https://github.com/typings/typings)
* Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/)
* Webpack (https://webpack.github.io/)
* React.js (https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Usage

Entry point is `src/main.jsx`.

To start webpack-dev-server simply run `gulp`.
